# Fantasy Formula 1

## It's Lights Out and Away You Go...
### ...With Your Own F1 Team!  
##

Looking to start a Fantasy F1 Championship amongst family, friends, or coworkers? 

Try Fantasy Formula 1:

- Choose *3 drivers each* to drive for your team
- Follow along for **weekly races** at iconic tracks like Monaco and Silverstone
- Compete for the ultimate prize, the ***Fantasy Constructor's Championship!***

This application will allow an *unlimited* amount of users to compete in a Fantasy Formula 1 league 
using their own custom-built teams. Examples of users could include family members, friends who follow
F1, or coworkers looking to host a friendly competition. 

Each team is constructed of *three drivers*, and points will be awarded according to the finishing placement 
of each driver at the end of each week's Grand Prix. The team with the most points at the conclusion of the season 
is crowned the champion, and any ties are resolved by selecting the team with the most wins overall; if another tie 
results, the champion is the team with the greater total number of fastest laps.

As a relatively new fan of Formula 1, this project will allow me to connect with others who enjoy watching
weekend races and engaging in a fun contest that spans the F1 season. Moreover, running any Fantasy league is 
a multi-faceted process and provides many opportunities for me to demonstrate my knowledge of software construction.
